    Types of Assertive Sentences

Every day, we utter tens of thousands of words to convey our thoughts, feelings, and actions, and each one has a specific purpose depending on its context. In this, you must have heard about assertive sentences too. But what exactly is an Assertive Sentence, and how is it defined? The term “Assertive Sentence” refers to a sentence stating a truth or a proposition without equivocation. This article will examine Assertive Sentences of both their affirmative and negative types.

What is an Assertive Sentence?

An assertive sentence is a declaration of the claim. The word “assertive” alone conveys the message of the statement. Facts, history, views, events, feelings, and beliefs are all covered in one statement. This is a popular statement in books, papers, and reports, but it may also be found in essays. With a full stop, a forceful statement is complete (.) Assertive sentences make up the majority of English sentences.

Simple statements are used in declarative phrases. There is no limit to how long a declarative phrase may be. Even if the length of the words fluctuates, the subject and predicate are always present. In the chapter ‘The sentence,’ we already saw this.

Some instances of declarative phrases are shown below. Take a look at this:

    East is the direction in which the Sun rises.
    We’re not related to you in any way.
    I cherish every one of you.

Types of Assertive Sentences

There are two types of assertive sentences, which are:

    Affirmative assertive sentence
    Negative assertive sentence

Declarative phrases may be positive or negative, depending on how they are worded. We’ll go into this further later.

We utilise an affirmative tone in the affirmative assertive phrase.

Here are some examples of assertive phrases that are positive and confident. Look at this-

Negative Assertive Sentence

A negative set of words is used in an assertive negative phrase. The opposite of a positive set of words is a negative one. This ensemble conveys a negative vibe.

Negatively forceful statements like these might be used to make a point. Look at this-
