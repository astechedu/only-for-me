Others

Other common auxiliary verbs are:

These are also known as modal verbs. We use them to show obligation, possibility and necessity.

For example:

  I should clean my room today. (obligation)
  I must wear a tie to school. (necessity)

Answering questions

Auxiliary verbs are useful in giving short answers to questions.

Basically, your answer can end with the auxiliary verb.

The following examples are natural and completely acceptable ways to answer questions:

  Do you like reading?

  Yes, I do (like reading)

  Can you speak English?

  Yes, I can (speak English)

  Do you have a sister?

  No, I don't (have a sister)



# Using 'have' and 'has'

Maltese fishing boats

  "Malta has colourful fishing boats."
  "The fishermen have traditional boats."

Here are some points to remember when using 'have' and 'has'.


Let's start with the basics.

They can both be used to show possession and are important in making the 'perfect tenses'.

'Had' is the past tense of both 'has' and 'have'.

have

Have is used with some pronouns and plural nouns:

  'I have a great English teacher.'
  'You have toothpaste on your chin.'
  'We have a meeting at 12.'
  'Nurses have a difficult job.'


has

Has is used with the third person singular. For example:

  'She has a great personality.'
  'He has a new haircut.'
  'The washing machine has a leak in it'.
  'It has a hole near the door.'

contractions

  I have = I've
  you have = you've
  we have = we've
  they have = They've
  he has = he's
  it has = it's

negative contractions

  has not = hasn't
  have not = haven't
  had not = hadn't

'have' and 'has' in questions

  'Have you been to Australia?'
  'Has Andrew left yet?'
  'Who has my pen?'
  'Has anyone seen my mobile phone?'
  'have got' and 'have'

Both 'have got' and 'have' mean the same thing. There is no difference.

  'I have got an i-phone.' = 'I have an i-phone'.
  'You have got a message.' = You have a message.'
  'She has got no time to sleep.' ='She has no time to sleep.'
  'have' and 'has' verb tenses

'have/has'' is an important verb in making the 'perfect tense':

Present Perfect

  'She has lived here for a long time.'
  'We have seen this TV show before.'
  'I have cut my finger.'

Past Perfect

  'I had already decided not to go before he asked me.'
  'They had finished the race before it started raining.'
  'She had already left when he arrived'

modal verbs: 'have to'

'have to' is used to mean that something is necessary. It is used in the following way in affirmative sentences:

subject + modal (have to / has to) + verb

  'I have to wash my car today.'
  'He has to write a report.'
  'I had to go to the bank yesterday.'
  'have to' in negative sentences

In negatives to show that something is not necessary we follow this rule:

subject + doesn't have to + verb

  'We don't have to work tomorrow.'
  'She doesn't have to wear a uniform to school'
  'I didn't have to make my bed when I was young'
