I should clean my room today. (obligation)

I must wear a tie to school. (necessity)

Auxiliary verbs are useful in giving short answers to questions.

Basically, your answer can end with the auxiliary verb.

Yes, I do (like reading)

Can you speak English?
Yes, I can (speak English)

Do you have a sister?
