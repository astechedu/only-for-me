# The 8 Parts of Speech

Every word is a part of speech. The term “part of speech” refers to the role a word plays in a sentence. And like any workplace or TV show with an ensemble cast, these roles were designed to work together. 




# 1 Nouns

A noun is a word that names person, place, concept, or object. Basically, anything that names a “thing” is a noun, whether you’re talking about a basketball court, San Francisco, Cleopatra, or self-preservation. 

Nouns fall into two categories: common nouns and proper nouns. Common nouns are general names for things, like planet and game show. Proper nouns are specific names for individual things, like Jupiter and Jeopardy!




# 2 Pronouns

Pronouns are the words you substitute for specific nouns when the reader or listener knows which specific noun you’re referring to. 

You might say “Jennifer was supposed to be here at eight,” then follow it with “she’s always late; next time I’ll tell her to be here a half-hour earlier.” 

Instead of saying Jennifer’s name three times in a row, you substituted she and her and your sentences remained grammatically correct. Pronouns are divided into a range of categories, and we cover them all in our guide to pronouns: 



# 3 Adjectives

Adjectives are the words that describe nouns. Think about your favorite movie. How would you describe it to a friend who’s never seen it?

You might say the movie was funny, engaging, well-written, or suspenseful. When you’re describing the movie with these words, you’re using adjectives. An adjective can go right before the noun it’s describing (I have a black dog), but it doesn’t have to. Sometimes, adjectives are at the end of a sentence (my dog is black).




# 4 Verbs

Go! Be amazing! Run as fast as you can! Win the race! Congratulate every participant who put in the work and competed!

These bolded words are verbs. Verbs are words that describe specific actions, like running, winning, and being amazing. 

Not all verbs refer to literal actions, though. Verbs that refer to feelings or states of being, like to love and to be, are known as nonaction verbs. Conversely, the verbs that do refer to literal actions are known as action verbs.



# 5 Adverbs

An adverb is a word that describes an adjective, a verb, or another adverb. Take a look at these examples:

Here’s an example: I entered the room quietly. Quietly is describing how you entered (verb) the room.

Here’s another example: A cheetah is always faster than a lion. Always is describing how frequently a cheetah is faster (adjective) than a lion.




# 6 Prepositions

Prepositions tell you the relationship between the other words in a sentence. 

Here’s an example: I left my bike leaning against the garage. In this sentence, against is the preposition because it tells us where I left my bike. 

Here’s another example: She put the pizza in the oven. Without the preposition in, we don’t know where the pizza is. 




# 7 Conjunctions

Conjunctions make it possible to build complex sentences that express multiple ideas. 

I like marinara sauce. I like alfredo sauce. I don’t like puttanesca sauce. Each of these three sentences expresses a clear idea. There’s nothing wrong with listing your preferences like this, but it’s not the most efficient way to do it. 

Consider instead: I like marinara sauce and alfredo sauce, but I don’t like puttanesca sauce. 

In this sentence, and and but are the two conjunctions that link your ideas together. 



# 8 Articles

A pear. The brick house. An exciting experience. These bolded words are known as articles. 

Like nouns, articles come in two flavors: definite articles and indefinite articles. And just like the two types of nouns, the type of article you use depends on how specific you need to be about the thing you’re discussing. 

A definite article describes one specific noun, like the and this. Example: Did you buy the car?

Now swap in an indefinite article: Did you buy a car?

See how the implication is gone and you’re asking a much more general question?

# 1 Noun


What Is a Noun? Definitions and Examples


Nouns are everywhere in our writing. But what are all the types of nouns you come across, and how do you use them?
What is a noun?

A noun is a word that names something, such as a person, place, thing, or idea. In a sentence, nouns can play the role of subject, direct object, indirect object, subject complement, object complement, appositive, or adjective.



Types of nouns

Nouns form a large proportion of English vocabulary and they come in a wide variety of types. Nouns can name a person:

Albert Einstein

the president

my mother

a girl

Nouns can also name a place:

Mount Vesuvius

Disneyland

my bedroom

Nouns can also name things, although sometimes they might be intangible things, such as concepts, activities, or processes. Some might even be hypothetical or imaginary things.

shoe

faucet

freedom

The Elder Wand

basketball

Proper nouns vs. common nouns

One important distinction to be made is whether a noun is a proper noun or a common noun. A proper noun is a specific name of a person, place, or thing, and is always capitalized.

Does Tina have much homework to do this evening?

Tina is the name of a specific person.



I would like to visit Old Faithful.

Old Faithful is the specific name of a geological phenomenon.

The opposite of a proper noun is a common noun, sometimes known as a generic noun. A common noun is the generic name of an item in a class or group and is not capitalized unless appearing at the beginning of a sentence or in a title.

The girl crossed the river.

Girl is a common noun; we do not learn the identity of the girl by reading this sentence, though we know the action she takes. River is also a common noun in this sentence.
Types of common nouns

Common or generic nouns can be broken down into three subtypes: concrete nouns, abstract nouns, and collective nouns. A concrete noun is something that is perceived by the senses; something that is physical or real.

I heard the doorbell.

My keyboard is sticky.

Doorbell and keyboard are real things that can be sensed.

Conversely, an abstract noun is something that cannot be perceived by the senses.

We can’t imagine the courage it took to do that.

Courage is an abstract noun. Courage can’t be seen, heard, or sensed in any other way, but we know it exists.

A collective noun denotes a group or collection of people or things.

That pack of lies is disgraceful.

Pack of lies as used here is a collective noun. Collective nouns take a singular verb as if they are one entity – in this case, the singular verb is.

A pride of lions roamed the savanna.

Pride of lions is also a collective noun.
Nouns as subjects

Every sentence must have a subject, and that subject will always be a noun. The subject of a sentence is the person, place, or thing that is doing or being the verb in that sentence.

Maria is happy.

Maria is the subject of this sentence and the corresponding verb is a form of to be (is).
Nouns as objects

Nouns can also be objects of a verb in a sentence. An object can be either a direct object (a noun that receives the action performed by the subject) or an indirect object (a noun that is the recipient of a direct object).

Give the books to her.

Books is a direct object (what is being given) and her is the indirect object (who the books are being given to).
Nouns as subject and object complements

Another type of noun use is called a subject complement. In this example, the noun teacher is used as a subject complement.

Mary is a teacher.

Subject complements normally follow linking verbs like to be, become, or seem. A teacher is what Mary is.

A related usage of nouns is called an object complement.

I now pronounce you husband and wife.

Husband and wife are nouns used as object complements in this sentence. Verbs that denote making, naming, or creating are often followed by object complements.
Appositive nouns and nouns as modifiers

An appositive noun is a noun that immediately follows another noun in order to further define or identify it.

My brother, Michael, is six years old.

Michael is an appositive here, further identifying the subject of the sentence, my brother.

Sometimes, nouns can be used adjectivally as well.

He is a speed demon.

Speed is a normally a noun, but here it is acting as an adjective to modify demon.
Plural nouns

Plural nouns, unlike collective nouns, require plural verbs. Many English plural nouns can be formed by adding -s or -es to the singular form, although there are many exceptions.

cat—cats

These two cats are both black.

Note the plural verb are.

tax—taxes

house—houses

Countable nouns vs. uncountable nouns

Countable nouns are nouns which can be counted, even if the number might be extraordinarily high (like counting all the people in the world). Countable nouns can be used with a/an, the, some, any, a few, and many.

Here is a cat.

Cat is singular and—obviously—countable.

Here are a few cats.

Here are some cats.

Uncountable nouns, or mass nouns,  are nouns that come in a state or quantity which is impossible to count; liquids are uncountable, as are things that act like liquids (sand, air). They are always considered to be singular, and can be used with some, any, a little, and much.



An I.Q. test measures intelligence.

Intelligence is an uncountable noun.

Students don’t seem to have much homework these days.

This example refers to an unspecified, unquantifiable amount of homework, so homework is an uncountable noun.
Possessive nouns

Possessive nouns are nouns which possess something; i.e., they have something. You can identify a possessive noun by the apostrophe; most nouns show the possessive with an apostrophe and an s.

The cat’s toy was missing.

The cat possesses the toy, and we denote this by use of ’s at the end of cat.

When a singular noun ends in the letter s or z, the same format often applies. This is a matter of style, however, and some style guides suggest leaving off the extra s.

I have been invited to the boss’s house for dinner.

Mrs. Sanchez’s coat is still hanging on the back of her chair.

Plural nouns ending in s take only an apostrophe to form a possessive.

My nieces’ prom dresses were exquisite.

What are nouns?

Nouns refer to a person, place, thing, or idea. They make up the subjects, direct objects, and indirect objects in a sentence, along with other roles. 
What are examples of nouns?

Nouns can be living things (Keanu Reeves or cat), places (beach or Detroit), things (ruler or PlayStation 5), or ideas (nihilism or the theory of evolution). 
What are the different types of nouns?

Common nouns refer to general things (like parks), and proper nouns refer to a specific thing (like Yellow

stone National Park). Nouns can also be plural or singular, depending on how many there are, and countable or uncountable, depending on how their plural form is used. 
How do you identify a noun in a sentence?

Nouns usually have articles (the, a, or an) before them in a sentence, but not always. Sometimes you’ll see adjectives or words like “some” or “this” before nouns. Aside from the first word in a sentence, if a word is capitalized then it’s a noun, such as a person’s name. 
Your writing, at its best.




# 2 Pronoun


What Are Pronouns? Definitions and Examples

You use pronouns every day. In fact, even if you don’t know what pronouns are, you use them—and in this sentence alone, we’ve now used pronouns four times. 

Pronouns are the words you substitute for other nouns when your reader or listener already knows which nouns you’re referring to. For example, you might say, “I have a dog. He’s brown and white.” There’s no need to clarify that you’re describing your dog in the second sentence because you already mentioned him in the first. But following up “I have a dog” with “brown and white” is grammatically incorrect . . . so with the pronoun “he’s,” you turn the phrase “brown and white” into a full sentence: He’s brown and white. 


Pronouns do a whole lot more than turn phrases into sentences. They provide context, make your sentences’ meanings clearer, and shape how we perceive people and things. Read on to learn about the different ways we use pronouns and how to use them to construct sentences.

What is a pronoun?

Pronouns are short words we swap in for other nouns to make our writing and speech faster and more varied. They’re words like:

    They
    I 
    You
    Who
    Themselves
    Each other

Pronouns make up a small subcategory of nouns. The distinguishing characteristic of pronouns is that they can be substituted for other nouns. For instance, if you’re telling a story about your sister Sarah, the story will begin to sound repetitive if you keep repeating “Sarah” over and over again. For example: 

    Sarah has always loved fashion. Sarah announced that Sarah wants to go to fashion school.

You could try to mix it up by sometimes referring to Sarah as “my sister,” but then it sounds like you’re referring to two different people:

    Sarah has always loved fashion. My sister announced that Sarah wants to go to fashion school.

Instead, you can use the pronouns she and her to refer to Sarah:

    Sarah has always loved fashion. She announced that she wants to go to fashion school.

Pronouns can replace both proper and common nouns. Certain pronouns have specific rules about when they can be used, such as how it should never be used to refer to a human being. We explain all of the different types and their associated rules below.
Personal pronouns

When you think of pronouns, you most likely think of personal pronouns. Personal pronouns are pronouns that refer to specific individuals and groups. Personal pronouns include:

    I/me
    She/her
    He/him
    They/them
    We/us
    You

Here are a few examples of personal pronouns in italics, with the nouns they’re referring to bolded:

    The new student will arrive today. They will need a seating assignment and a name tag. 
    My family loves nachos. We make them every Friday for movie night.

In the second example sentence, notice that nachos (a noun) and them (a pronoun) aren’t emphasized. That’s because in this sentence, them isn’t a personal pronoun because it isn’t replacing a proper noun, but rather we is.  
Antecedents

Remember how we mentioned that in order to use a pronoun, you need to introduce the noun first? That noun has a name: an antecedent. 

Antecedents are necessary because pronouns are versatile. Think about it—“it” can refer to a bike, a tree, a car, or a city, and we just used it to refer to something else entirely: pronouns’ versatility. Take a look at these examples to see how antecedents and pronouns work together:

    My family tests my patience, but I love them. 
    The sign was too far away for Jorge to read it. 
    Danita said she is almost finished with the application.

Antecedents aren’t necessary when the reader/listener knows who or what you’re discussing. Generally, you don’t need an antecedent for pronouns like I, you, we, our, and me. But because there are no absolutes in grammar, sometimes you do need an antecedent in this kind of situation—like when you’re giving a speech where you introduce yourself and your credentials before discussing your achievements. 

There are also circumstances where you might not introduce the noun first and instead reveal it after using only pronouns to refer to your subject. You might do this for dramatic or poetic effect in a piece of creative writing. 
Relative pronouns

Relative pronouns are another class of pronouns. They connect relative clauses to independent clauses. Often, they introduce additional information about something mentioned in the sentence. Relative pronouns include these words: 

    that 
    what 
    which 
    who 
    whom 

Traditionally, who refers to people, and which and that refer to animals or things. Here are a few examples of relative pronouns at work:

    The woman who called earlier didn’t leave a message. 
    All the dogs that got adopted today will be loved. 
    My car, which is nearly twenty years old, still runs well.

Who vs. whom—subject and object pronouns

Knowing when to use who and when to use whom trips a lot of writers up. The difference is actually pretty simple: Who is for the subject of a sentence, and whom is for the object of a verb or preposition. Here’s a quick example: 

    Who mailed this package?
    To whom was this package sent?

See the difference? Who is a subject pronoun. It’s in the same category as I, he, she, they, and we. Whom is an object pronoun, which puts it in the same category as me, him, her, them, and us. An easy way to determine whether you should use who or whom in a sentence is to answer the sentence’s question by substituting another pronoun. With the new pronoun in place, determine if the sentence still makes sense. For example: 

    He mailed this package.
    The package was sent to him. 

Figuring out when to use whom can be more difficult than knowing when to use who because it typically comes before the sentence’s verb—notice how the example object pronoun sentence changed more dramatically than the subject pronoun sentence.  
Demonstrative pronouns

That, this, these, and those are demonstrative pronouns. They take the place of a noun or noun phrase that has already been mentioned or is clear through context, either in written or verbal communication.

This is used for singular items that are nearby. These is used for multiple items that are nearby. The distance can be physical or metaphorical. Take a look at these examples:

    Here is a letter with no return address. Who could have sent this? 
    What a fantastic idea! This is the best thing I’ve heard all day. 
    If you think gardenias smell nice, try smelling these.

That is used for singular items that are far away. Those is used for multiple items that are far away. Again, the distance can be physical or metaphorical. Here are a few examples of these pronouns in action:

    A house like that would be a nice place to live. 
    Some new flavors of soda came in last week. Why don’t you try some of those? 
    Those aren’t swans, they’re geese.

Indefinite pronouns

Indefinite pronouns are used when you need to refer to a person or thing that doesn’t need to be specifically identified. Some common indefinite pronouns are one, other, none, some, anybody, everybody, and no one. 

Here are a few examples of indefinite pronouns in sentences:

    Everybody was late to work because of the traffic jam. 
    It matters more to some than others. 
    Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen.

When indefinite pronouns function as subjects of a sentence or clause, they usually take singular verbs.
Reflexive pronouns

Reflexive pronouns end in -self or -selves: 

    Myself 
    Yourself 
    Himself
    Herself 
    Itself
    Oneself
    Ourselves
    Yourselves 
    Themselves

Use a reflexive pronoun when both the subject and object of a verb refer to the same person or thing. Here are a few examples:

    She checked herself out of the hotel thirty minutes before check-out time.
    Take care of yourselves.

Using myself when you mean me is a common mistake writers and speakers make. Reflexive pronouns are only correct when the subject and object of a sentence are the same. 
Intensive pronouns

Intensive pronouns look the same as reflexive pronouns, but their purpose is different. Intensive pronouns add emphasis. Conceptualizing the difference between them and reflexive pronouns can be challenging because the emphasis isn’t always obvious. Take a look at these examples of intensive pronouns and examine how they’re different from the examples in the previous section:

    I told them I could do it myself.
    We asked ourselves, is this business really worth saving?

If you can remove a pronoun from a sentence and it loses emphasis but its meaning stays the same, it’s most likely an intensive pronoun. Compare these two sentences:

    I built this house. 
    I built this house myself.

See how the second one emphasizes that the builder had no outside help? Intensive pronouns can help you express pride, shock, disbelief, credulousness (or incredulousness), or any other strong emotion. Here are a few more examples:

    They hiked the entire Appalachian Trail themselves?
    Did you, yourself, see Loretta spill the coffee?

Possessive pronouns

Possessive pronouns are pronouns that show possession. They include the following:

    My 
    Your
    Our
    Their
    His
    Her
    Its

These can also be called possessive adjectives if they modify a noun in a sentence. Take a look at these examples of possessive adjectives in action:

    I crashed my bike into a telephone pole.
    Your house is always decorated so nicely. 

This category also includes independent versions of possessive pronouns. These include:

    Mine
    Yours
    Ours
    His
    Hers
    Theirs 
    Its

When you use an independent possessive pronoun, you drop the noun it’s referring to. Here are a few examples: 

    She forgot her jacket, so I gave her mine.
    I had no idea whose bid won the auction, then my cousins told me theirs did. 

Interrogative pronouns

Interrogative pronouns are used in questions. The interrogative pronouns are who, what, which, and whose. Here are a few examples of interrogative pronouns at play:

    Who wants a bag of jelly beans? 
    What is your name? 
    Which movie do you want to watch? 
    Whose jacket is this?

Reciprocal pronouns

There are only two reciprocal pronouns:

    Each other
    One another

These pronouns refer to two or more people who are both the subject of the sentence. Take a look at these examples:

    Javier and Priya, the two top salespeople on our team, are competing with each other for Salesperson of the Year. 
    All my siblings are blaming one another for letting the boa constrictor out last Thanksgiving. 

Distributive pronouns

Distributive pronouns refer to people, animals, and objects as individuals within larger groups. They enable you to single out individuals while acknowledging that they’re part of a larger group. Distributive pronouns include the following:

    Either
    Each
    Neither
    Any 
    None

Here are a few examples of distributive pronouns in sentences:

    All of my friends entered the costume contest and none of them won.
    Cookies and muffins are available for dessert. Neither is appealing to me.





Pronoun examples

As you can see, pronouns do a lot. And there are a lot of them. And to make them even more complicated, many pronouns change forms when they’re used in different positions within a sentence or different tenses. 

Take a look at the different types of pronouns and their forms at a glance:

 
Type 	Pronouns in this category 	Example sentences
Personal 	I/me, they/them, he/him, she/her, it, we/us, you 	

    I brought all the snacks.
    We weren’t planning on staying over.

Relative 	That, what, which, who, whom 	

    My car, which is twenty years old, doesn’t connect to Bluetooth.
    The professor who ran the meeting ended it promptly

Demonstrative 	That, this, these, those 	

    You’ve seen clear quartz and smoky quartz, but have you seen these stones?
    I ordered Hawaiian pizza. I like that a lot.

Indefinite 	One, other, some, none, everybody, anybody, no one, nobody, both 	

    We need cashiers up front. Anybody who’s available, please report to the front end.
    “Why can’t we fix this?” I asked nobody in particular.

Reflexive 	Myself, yourself/yourselves, themself/themselves, herself, himself, oneself, itself, ourselves 	

    The car began to swerve, then corrected itself.
    He made himself a sandwich.

Intensive 	Myself, yourself/yourselves, themself/themselves, herself, himself, oneself, itself, ourselves 	

    You did all of this yourself?
    She did the entire group project by herself.

Possessive 	My, your, his, her, their, our, its, whose 	

    We’re lounging out by our pool.
    His car is green.

Interrogative 	Who, what, which, whose 	

    Whose bike is this?
    What is the answer?

Reciprocal 	Each other, one another 	

    We ran into each other on the subway.
    They’ve been fighting with one another for decades.

Distributive 	Either, each, neither, any, none 	

    Peanut butter or chocolate? I’m good with either. 
    There were four cats, and none had long hair.

Pronouns and gender identity

You might have noticed pronouns listed in some of your colleagues’ and friends’ email signatures or social media profiles. You might have even been prompted to list your pronouns in your own. While traditionally the personal pronouns he/him/his and she/her/hers were used for individuals based strictly on their sex, pronoun usage is broader and more descriptive today.

Many people use gender-neutral language like they/them/theirs and zie/hir/hirs because they feel these pronouns express their gender identity more accurately than she or he. The most common gender-neutral pronoun is the singular they. Today, it’s not uncommon to see the singular they as the default neutral pronoun. It’s what we use on the Grammarly blog, and for writers across the internet, it’s a concise catch-all pronoun that can fit just about any sentence. However, language is constantly evolving, and new types of singular third-person pronouns have emerged that refer to people entirely without reference to gender, such as noun-self pronouns.

Gender-neutral and gender-inclusive pronouns

When somebody tells you their pronouns, using their pronouns is an act of respect. Think of it like spelling or pronouncing that person’s name correctly—they’re the authority on who they are and how they express themselves, and referring to them the way they’ve asked you to refer to them affirms this. 

For some gender-neutral and gender-inclusive pronouns, the different forms to use are obvious. For others, they aren’t. Take a look at this table including some of the most common gender-neutral and inclusive pronouns:
Subject 	Object 	Possessive Determiner 	Possessive Pronoun 	Reflexive
ey 	em 	eir 	eirs 	emself
he 	him 	his 	his 	himself
ney 	nem 	nir 	nirs 	nemself
she 	her 	her 	hers 	herself
they 	them 	their 	theirs 	themself
ve 	ver 	vis 	vis 	verself
xe 	xem 	xyr 	xyrs 	xemself
ze 	hir 	hir 	hirs 	hirself
ze 	zir 	zir 	zirs 	zirself
zie 	hir 	hir 	hirs 	hirself
zie 	zir 	zir 	zirs 	zirself

If you ever aren’t sure of the correct pronouns to use when referring to somebody, just ask them! And if you accidentally use the wrong pronoun, simply apologize for doing so and make an effort to use the correct pronoun in future conversations.

# 3 Adjective


What Do Adjectives Modify?


Adjectives are words that modify nouns. They are often called “describing words” because they give us further details about a noun, such as what it looks like (the white horse), how many there are (the three boys) or which one it is (the last house). Adjectives do not modify verbs or other adjectives.


Most often, adjectives are easy to identify in a sentence because they fall right before the nouns they modify.

The old clock hung upon the wall.
A white horse galloped across the lush, green grass.
Have you met our three handsome boys?
Ours is the last house on the street.

In these sentences, old, white, lush, green, three, handsome, and last are all adjectives; they give us a more detailed description of the nouns they modify. An adjective might answer the mental questions, “What kind is it?” (as with an old clock, a white horse, the lush grass, the green grass, or the handsome boys), “How many are there?” (as with the three boys), or “Which one is it?” (as with the last house). Adjectives that answer the first question are descriptive adjectives. Those that answer the other two questions are limiting adjectives—they restrict or quantify a noun rather than describing it.

The five ladies go to Las Vegas every year.
Those flowers must go on that table.
She gave the best piece to her mother.

The examples above use the limiting adjectives five (how many ladies?), every (which year/s?), those (which flowers?), that (which table?), best (which piece?) and her (whose mother?). Technically, definite articles (the) and indefinite articles (a/an) also function as limiting adjectives.
Predicate Adjectives

Although many adjectives fall before the nouns they modify, as in the examples above, those used in sentences or clauses with linking verbs fall after the nouns they modify. Linking verbs describe a state of being rather than an action; the most common linking verb is to be, and others include sense verbs like appear, seem, look, sm

ell, sound, and taste.

Cynthia is fatigued .
Those muffins look delicious .
The sunrise seemed golden .
Do you think this spaghetti sauce tastes spicy ?

With linking verbs, adjectives like fatigued, delicious, golden, and spicy all fall after the nouns they modify (Cynthia, muffins, sunrise, spaghetti sauce).

Your writing, at its best.
