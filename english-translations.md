Now-a-days, corruption is soaring high in every sphere of society. Everyday a new scandal unfolds and makes a news in the newspaper. But the respected names associated with the same make wrong use of their power and the case gets closed before the accused is proved guilty.

Corruption is basically the degradation of moral values in human beings which ultimately has ruined the society we live in. Wealth seems to have become their only motto in life and they are ready to sell their souls for it. The restoration of old values, a big no to all the ways of achieving quick success and giving a chance to real talent can help eradicate this burning issue.

आजकल भ्रष्टाचार समाज के प्रत्येक क्षेत्र में अपनी चरम सीमा पर है। हर दिन एक नया घोटाला खुलता है और अखबार की खबर बन जाता है। परन्तु उससे जुड़े सम्मानित नाम अपनी शक्तियों का गलत प्रयोग करते हैं और इससे पहले कि अपराधी दोषी सिद्ध हो, केस बन्द हो जाता है।

भ्रष्टाचार मूलत: मनुष्यों में नैतिक मूल्यों का पतन है जिसने अन्ततः उस समाज को खराब कर दिया है जिसमें हम रहते हैं । धन ही उनका एकमात्र उद्देश्य बन गया है और वे इसके लिए अपनी आत्मा तक बेचने को तैयार हो जाते हैं। पुरातन मूल्यों की पुनः स्थापना करके, जल्द सफलता पाने के सभी रास्तों को न अपनाकर तथा सच्चे प्रतिभावान व्यक्तियों को अवसर प्रदान कर इस ज्वलंत मुद्दे को निपटाया जा सकता है।



The craze of going to foreign is on and even the attacks on Indians in many of the foreign countries have not curbed this craze a bit. Some go for the sake of quick money and some for a better lifestyle. Most of the Indians who are not well educated go for lower level jobs, like waiters, drivers and other labour. They are often treated disgracefully there. 

India is a country of brains. All our talented Doctors, Engineers, MBAs etc., get good jobs in foreign countries. One can easily think that if the same manpower of India work for the progress of India itself, success will be boundless. It is high time that we should put back our own desires and think and act as citizens of the country first.

विदेशों में जाने के प्रति उत्साह बढ़ता ही जा रहा है और दूसरे अनेक देशों में भारतीयों पर हुए हमलों के बावजूद भी इसमें जरा भी कमी नहीं आयी है। कुछ लोग शीघ्र पैसा कमाने के लिए जाते हैं और कुछ बेहतर जीवन जीने के लिए। अधिकतर भारतीय जो अच्छी तरह पढ़े लिखे नहीं हैं वे निम्न श्रेणी की नौकरियों, जैसे- वेटर, ड्राइवर और दूसरे मजदूरी के कामों के लिए जाते हैं। वहाँ उनके साथ प्रायः बहुत असम्मानजनक व्यवहार किया जाता है। 

भारत बुद्धिमानों का देश है। हमारे सभी योग्य डॉक्टर, इंजीनियर, MBAs आदि विदेशों में हाथों-हाथ लिये जाते हैं । कोई भी आसानी से सोच सकता है कि यदि भारत की यही मानव शक्ति भारत की उन्नति के लिए काम करे तो अपार सफलता प्राप्त होगी। अब समय आ गया जब हमें अपनी खुद की चाहतों को तिलांजलि देनी चाहिए और प्रथमतः देश के नागरिकों की तरह सोचें और कार्य करें ।




 
Food adulteration is an obnoxious fraud done by a man with the other men. Playing with the lives of people for making more and more money is brutality. Basically, the mixing of unwanted materials like dust, impurities, concrete particles etc., in any food item which matches its colour, size and texture is adulteration.

The typical examples of this are milk, spices, oil and ghee, pulses, etc. Not only it is like snatching money from people but also a form of befooling them by giving them poisonous and harmful eatables. They are playing with the lives of people. We must be very careful while purchasing eatables.

खाद्य पदार्थों में मिलावट एक घृणित धोखा है जो एक व्यक्ति द्वारा दूसरे व्यक्तियों के साथ किया जाता है। ज्यादा से ज्यादा पैसा कमाने के लिए लोगों के जीवन से खेलना क्रूरता है। मूलतः, अनचाहे पदार्थ जैसे- धूल, अशुद्धियाँ, पत्थर के कणों आदि को खाने के सामान में मिलाना जो उसके रंग, आकार और रूप बनावट आदि से मिलते हों, मिलावट है।

इसके विशेष उदाहरण हैं दूध, मसाले, तेल और घी, दालें इत्यादि । न केवल यह लोगों से पैसा छीनने के समान है बल्कि उन्हें जहरीले और हानिकारक खाद्य पदार्थ देकर, उन्हें मूर्ख बनाना है। वे लोगों के जीवन के साथ खिलवाड़ कर रहे हैं । खाद्य सामग्री क्रय करते समय हमें बहुत सावधान रहना चाहिये ।




'Hard work is the key to success', is an old but true saying which will remain valid till the endless generations to come. Many people escape from hard work and try to veil their laziness under the myths of futile thoughts. For example they base their tattered position of life and failure on destiny and turn to take a lame excuse for sitting completely idle.

Even if the role of destiny is admitted, it doesn't entitle anybody to stop doing his part of 'Karma’. The food on plate cannot be eaten without the movements of hand and mouth. Success encourages to work harder and discover new heights. However, failures also come but they must not be taken with the spirit of a loser. 


'कठिन परिश्रम ही सफलता की चाबी है', एक पुरानी परन्तु सच्ची कहावत है जो अंतहीन पीढ़ियों तक सही रहेगी। बहुत-से लोग कठिन परिश्रम से भागते हैं और अपने निकम्मेपन को बेकार के विचारों से छिपाने की कोशिश करते हैं। उदाहरण के रूप में जैसे कि वे जीवन की विपन्नता और असफलता के लिए भाग्य को जिम्मेदार मानते हैं और पूर्ण रूप से खाली बैठने के झूठे बहाने गढ़ते हैं।

यदि भाग्य की भूमिका को स्वीकारा भी जाये तो भी यह अपने कर्म को करने से रोकने की इजाजत नहीं देता। प्लेट में रखा खाना भी हाथ और मुँह को हिलाये बिना नहीं खाया जा सकता। सफलता कठिन परिश्रम करने के लिए और नई ऊँचाइयों को छूने के लिए उत्साहित करती है। हालांकि असफलताएँ भी आती हैं लेकिन उन्हें एक हारे हुए व्यक्ति की भावना से नहीं लेना चाहिए।





The internet culture has dawned on the globe together with its boon and doom. The whole world seems to have just fitted in a computer screen. But as everything has a positive as well as negative side, internet culture has promoted some wrong aspects too.

It can disrepute and destroy a person's life in a second. Internet hacking is a big danger to all the bank accounts, personal information, data and secret records which are stored in computer. Children are becoming internet maniac. Playstations and vulgar videos are on the way of ruining their life. So it must be used for constructive purposes rather than negative purposes.

इंटरनेट सभ्यता पृथ्वी पर वरदान और अभिशाप दोनों के साथ उभरी है। सारी दुनिया कम्प्यूटर के पर्दे पर सिमटकर आ गयी है। परन्तु जिस प्रकार हर चीज के सकारात्मक और नकारात्मक पहलू होते हैं, इन्टरनेट सभ्यता ने भी कुछ गलत पहलुओं को बढ़ावा दिया है। यह एक व्यक्ति को एक क्षण में ही बेइज्जत और उसकी जिन्दगी को बर्बाद कर सकता है।

इंटरनेट हैकिंग उन सभी बैंक खातों, व्यक्तिगत सूचनाओं, डाटा और गुप्त विवरणों के लिए एक बड़ा खतरा है जो कम्प्यूटर में संग्रहीत हैं। बच्चे इंटरनेट मेनिएक (अर्थात् इसे ज्यादा प्रयोग करने की आदत के शिकार) हो गये हैं। प्लेस्टेशन्ज़ और अश्लील वीडियोज़ उनके जीवन को बर्बाद करने के रास्ते पर हैं। इस प्रकार इसका प्रयोग नकारात्मक उद्देश्यों की बजाय संरचनात्मक उद्देश्यों के लिए होना चाहिए।



The flora and fauna are on the verge of extinction. The deforestation for satisfying the needs of growing population has increased. The destroyed jungles have disturbed the whole food chain which has affected animals too. The hunting of animals for various purposes has minimised their number too.

The keeping of animals away from their natural habitats gives a hand in reducing their survival rate. Afforestation, curb on human population, intelligent and minimal use of these natural resources etc., are some of the measures which must be strictly observed to give a prosperous and wealthy future to the next generations.


वनस्पति और पशु वर्ग समाप्त होने के कगार पर हैं। बढ़ती हुई जनसंख्या की जरूरतों को संतुष्ट करने के लिये वृक्ष कटाव बहुत अधिक बढ़ गया है । बर्बाद हुए जंगलों ने पूरी खाद्य श्रृंखला को बाधित कर दिया है जिससे जानवर भी प्रभावित हुए हैं। विभिन्न उद्देश्यों के लिए जानवरों का शिकार करने से भी उनकी संख्या कम हो गयी है।

जानवरों को उनके प्राकृतिक आवास स्थान से दूर रखने से भी उनके जीने की दर कम हो रही है। वृक्षारोपण, मानव जनसंख्या पर रोक, प्राकृतिक संसाधनों का बुद्धिमत्तापूर्ण और कम-से-कम प्रयोग आदि कुछ ऐसे उपाय हैं जिनका कठोरता से पालन आने वाली पीढ़ियों को एक सुसम्पन्न भविष्य देने के लिए करना ही होगा ।




'Health is wealth' has been rightly remarked. For a good health, just regular exercise is not enough. One has to be conscious about the eating habits also. Cereals, pulses, vegetables, salad, fruits, milk must be the essential constituents of a diet chart. Junk food which is popular amongst the present generation is really harmful for us.

The problem of obesity is the result of this modern fast food menu. A fat person faces many problems such as high blood pressure and heart diseases. A balanced diet is the answer to almost all the health problems. There should be a perfect combination of carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, proteins and minerals in it.


'स्वास्थ्य ही धन है' ठीक ही कहा गया है। अच्छे स्वास्थ्य के लिए केवल रोज की कसरत ही काफी नहीं है । हर एक को अपनी खाने की आदतों के प्रति भी जागरूक होना होगा। अनाज, दालें, सब्जियाँ, सलाद, फल, दूध आहार चार्ट के आवश्यक तत्व होने चाहिए। जंक खाना जो वर्तमान पीढ़ी में बहुत लोकप्रिय है हमारे लिए वास्तविक रूप से नुकसानदायक है।

मोटापा आधुनिक फास्टफूड मीनू की देन है । एक मोटा आदमी उच्च रक्तचाप और हृदय रोगों जैसी बहुत सी समस्याओं का सामना करता है। एक संतुलित आहार सभी स्वास्थ्य संबंधी परेशानियों का जवाब है । इसमें कार्बोहाइड्रेट, वसा, विटामिन, प्रोटीन, खनिज लवण का उचित मिश्रण होना चाहिए ।




Now-a-days, bottled water is available under different brand names at every place. Every brand lavishly claims about its nutritional qualities. It is available not only in small bottles of one or two litres but also in big jars of 20 or 25 litres. Usually, people call it safe drinking water.

But the question is, how safe is this bottled water for drinking? Most mineral water companies in India just pump water from tubewell or borewell which they see is conveniently located. Apart from this, most of the bottled water in India is bottled in PVC bottles, which is generally unfit for drinking..(PVC = पी वी सी = प्लास्टिक से बना मजबूत पदार्थ जो बोतल बनाने में प्रयुक्त होता है।)

आजकल, बोतलबन्द पानी विभिन्न नामों से प्रत्येक स्थान पर उपलब्ध है । प्रत्येक ब्राण्ड बढ़-चढ़कर इसके पौष्टिक तत्वों के गुणों का दावा करता है । यह सिर्फ 1 या 2 लीटरों की छोटी बोतलों में ही नहीं बल्कि 20 से 25 लीटर तक के बड़े जारों में भी उपलब्ध है । अधिकांशतः, लोग इसे पीने का सुरक्षित पानी मानते हैं ।

लेकिन प्रश्न यह उठता है कि पीने के लिये यह बोतलबन्द पानी कितना सुरक्षित है ? भारत में ज्यादातर खनिज जल की कम्पनियाँ आसपास में जो भी ट्यूबवैल या बोरवैल सुविधाजनक रूप से उपलब्ध होता है, उसी पानी को प्रयोग में लाती हैं । इसके अलावा भारत में ज्यादातर पानी PVC बोतलों में पैक किया जाता है । PVC बोतलें सामान्यतः पीने के पानी हेतु सुरक्षित नहीं होती हैं ।





In India women are given most respected position in the society from the ancient time. They are given the position of Goddess Lakshmi in the Indian society. Indian women are found working in all fields like aeronautics, space, politics, banks, schools, sports, business, army, police, and many more.

It is all that what we see with our open eyes however, if we see behind the curtain we will find all the crimes against women at homes, offices, streets, etc. When we see these crimes against women in India such as rape cases, acid attacks, etc., the safety of women has been in doubt. We should make their life safe from all these evils.

भारत में प्राचीनकाल से ही नारियों को समाज में बहुत ही सम्मानित स्थान दिया जाता है। भारतीय समाज में नारियों को देवी लक्ष्मी का स्वरूप प्रदान किया गया है। जीवन के प्रत्येक क्षेत्र में चाहे वे विमान, अंतरिक्ष, राजनीति, बैंक, स्कूल, खेलकूद व्यापार, सेना, पुलिस के क्षेत्र हों सभी में नारियों को भाग लेते हम देख सकते हैं।

यह सब हम अपनी आखों से प्रत्यक्ष रूप में देखते हैं यद्यपि पर्दे के पीछे हम पायेंगे कि नारियों के विरोध में ही घरों पर, कार्यालयों में, गलियों में सभी प्रकार के अपराध होते हैं। नारियों के विरुद्ध हुए अपराध जैसे बलात्कार, तेजाबी आक्रमण आदि के कारण नारियों की सुरक्षा संदेह के घेरे में है। हमें इन सब बुराइयों से उनके जीवन को सुरक्षित बनाना चाहिए।





'Make in India' campaign is a new plan launched by the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, to give foreign investors a chance to invest in India in number of businesses. It is an initiative campaign run by the Government of India to cheer up multinational companies as well as domestic companies at national and international level in order to manufacture products in India. It is the praiseworthy effort made by the PM to bring employment in India. This campaign was launched by him on 25th of September, 2014 at the Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi.

'Make in India' प्रधानमंत्री नरेन्द्र मोदी द्वारा चलाया गया नया अभियान है ताकि विदेशी निवेशक भारत में अनेक व्यापारिक क्षेत्रों में निवेश कर सकें। भारत सरकार द्वारा चलाए जाने वाला यह लाभकारी अभियान है जिससे बहुराष्ट्रीय कम्पनियां तथा देश की राष्ट्रीय व अंतर्राष्ट्रीय स्तर की कम्पनियां भारत में ही उत्पाद निर्मित कर सकें। प्रधानमंत्री द्वारा भारत में रोजगार के अवसर प्रदान करने का यह सराहनीय प्रयास है। उन्होंने विज्ञान भवन नई दिल्ली में 25 सितम्बर, 2014 को इस अभियान का श्रीगणेश किया था।





'Cleanliness is next to Godliness' means cleanliness leads the way to godliness or goodness. Through the practice of the proper cleanliness we can keep ourselves physically and mentally clean which really make us good, civilized and healthy human being.

It helps to make good personality and thus, good impression on others. Cleanliness shows clean character of a person through his/her clean dresses and make their good personality. People with good character become moral and religious in their life and make their mind and soul clean and peaceful. 

'ईश्वर के बाद स्वच्छता ही सर्वोपरि है', इसका तात्पर्य है कि स्वच्छता ही हमें ईश्वर की ओर या अच्छे बनने की दिशा में प्रेरित करती है। स्वच्छता के उचित अभ्यास से हम स्वयं को शारीरिक व मानसिक रूप से स्वच्छ रख सकते हैं जो हमें अच्छा, सभ्य और स्वस्थ इन्सान बना सकती है।

यह हमारे व्यक्तित्व को श्रेष्ठ बनाने और इस प्रकार दूसरों पर अच्छा प्रभाव डालने में सहायक है। स्वच्छता व्यक्ति के साफ-सुथरे पहनावे और व्यक्तित्व द्वारा उसके बेदाग चरित्र को भी उजागर करती है। अच्छे चरित्र के व्यक्ति अपने जीवन में नैतिक व धार्मिक हो जाते हैं तथा अपने मस्तिष्क और आत्मा को पवित्र और एवं शान्त बनाते हैं।






'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao' is a government social scheme launched by the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi in order to address the gender imbalance and discrimination against girl child in the Indian society. This scheme was launched by the Prime Minister on 22nd of Janaury, in 2015 at Panipat, Haryana.

This scheme is to aware people about the importance of girls in the society. It is to increase awareness among common people to save the lives of girl child by completely removing the female foeticide. People should celebrate the birth of their girl child and educate them with full responsibility as they do for their boy child. 

'बेटी बचाओ बेटी पढ़ाओ' एक सरकारी सामाजिक योजना है जिसे प्रधानमंत्री श्री नरेन्द्र मोदी द्वारा प्रारंभ किया गया है जिसके माध्यम से लिंग के असंतुलन को ठीक किया जा सके और भारतीय समाज में कन्याओं के साथ होने वाला भेदभाव दूर किया जा सके। यह योजना 22 जनवरी 2015 को हरियाणा के पानीपत में प्रधानमंत्री द्वारा प्रारंभ की गई।

यह योजना समाज में कन्याओं के महत्व को जानने के विषय में लोगों को सचेत करने के लिए बनी है। यह योजना सभी लोगों के हृदय में कन्या भ्रूण हत्या की भावना को जड़ से समाप्त करने के लिए उन्हें सचेत करने के लिए प्रारंभ की गई है। लोग जिस प्रकार अपने पुत्र का जन्मोत्सव मनाते हैं उसी प्रकार उन्हें अपनी बेटियों का जन्मोत्सव भी मनाना चाहिए तथा उन्हें अपने पुत्र की भाँति अधिक से अधिक शिक्षा प्रदान करनी चाहिए।





'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan' is also called as the 'Clean India Mission' or 'Swachh Bharat Campaign'. It is a national level campaign run by the Indian Government to cover all the backward towns to make them clean.

This campaign involves the construction of latrines, promoting sanitation programmes in the rural areas, cleaning streets, roads and changing the infrastructure of the country to lead the country ahead. This campaign was officially launched by the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi on 145th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd of October 2014 at Rajghat, New Delhi. 

'स्वच्छ भारत अभियान' को ही 'क्लीन इन्डिया मिशन' या 'स्वच्छ भारत कॅम्पेन' भी कहते हैं। यह अभियान राष्ट्रीय स्तर का है जिसे भारत सरकार द्वारा सभी पिछड़े कस्बों को साफ सुथरा बनाने के लिए चलाया गया है। इस अभियान के अन्तर्गत शौचालयों का निर्माण, ग्रामीण इलाकों में स्वच्छता के कार्यक्रमों को बढ़ावा देना, गलियों, सड़कों की साफ-सफाई तथा देश के बुनियादी ढांचे में परिवर्तन करना आता है ताकि देश तरक्की कर आगे बढ़ सके। महात्मा गाँधी के 145वें जन्म दिन पर 2 अक्टूबर 2014 को दिल्ली के राजघाट पर प्रधानमंत्री नरेन्द्र मोदी ने इस अभियान की शुरुआत की थी।




As we all know that earth is the only known planet having life in this universe. So we should respect and maintain everything we get from our mother earth and save it so that our future generations can live in a safe environment. We can do so by saving trees, natural vegetation water, natural resources, etc. We should strictly follow all the possible measures to control the environmental pollution and global warming.

Everyone should plant more and more trees in the surrounding areas to curb the pollution and reduce the effects of global warming. We should save our natural resources like minerals, coal, stones, oil, water etc.

जैसा कि हम सब जानते हैं कि ब्रह्माण्ड में पृथ्वी ही ऐसा ग्रह है जिसमें जीवन है। अतः हमें अपनी मातृभूमि का सम्मान करना चाहिए और इससे हमें जो कुछ भी प्राप्त होता है उसे बनाए रखना चाहिए। हमें मातृभूमि की रक्षा करनी चाहिए ताकि भावी पीढ़ी सुरक्षित वातावरण में रह सकें।

वृक्षों, प्राकृतिक वनस्पति, जल, प्राकृतिक संसाधनों आदि की रक्षाकर हम ऐसा कर सकते हैं। हमें पर्यावरण विषयक प्रदूषण और वैश्विक गर्मी को नियन्त्रित करने के लिए कठोरता से सभी संभव उपाय अपनाने चाहिए। प्रत्येक को अपने चारों ओर प्रदूषण को रोकने और वैश्विक तापन के प्रभाव को कम करने के लिए अधिक से अधिक पेड़ लगाने चाहिए। हमें अपने प्राकृतिक संसाधनों जैसे खनिज पदार्थ, कोयला, पत्थर, तेल, जल आदि की रक्षा करनी चाहिए।





One should not waste one's valuable time. If you waste time, time will waste you. Those who know the value of time don't waste even a single minute. This is called punctuality. If your officer wants you at 9 p.m., it is a credit to reach at 9 p.m.

Those who are always on time are noted to be good employees by their boss. Confusion arises in mind about the man as to why he fails to come on time. Has anything happened to him ? Or is he not at all eager to come ? The man coming on time avoids all these doubts. He raises his value in society, with friends and relations. People have good opinion about a punctual man.

व्यक्ति को अपना अमूल्य समय व्यर्थ नहीं गंवाना चाहिये । यदि आप समय नष्ट करते हैं तो समय आपको नष्ट कर देगा। जो लोग समय का मूल्य जानते हैं, वे एक मिनट भी नष्ट नहीं करते। इसी को समय की पाबंदी कहते हैं। यदि आपका अधिकारी आपकी 9 बजे हाजिरी चाहता है तो 9 बजे ही पहुँचना एक गुण है। जो लोग सदैव समय के पाबन्द रहते हैं उनके विषय में मालिक की राय अच्छी बनती है ।

समय पर न आने के कारण उस व्यक्ति के प्रति दिमाग में तरह-तरह के गड़बड़ विचार पैदा होते हैं कि आने वाला क्यों नहीं आया। क्या कोई दुर्घटना तो नहीं हो गई? अथवा कहीं उसकी आने की अनिच्छा तो नहीं है ? समय पर आने वाले के प्रति इन सब विचारों के पैदा होने का अवसर ही नहीं होता है। वह समाज में, सम्बन्धियों में और दोस्तों में अपना महत्त्व बढ़ा लेता है । लोग समय के पाबंद व्यक्ति के बारे में अच्छी राय रखते हैं ।




India is a wonderful land. Its area is vast. Its large population and geographical conditions are astonishing. All the living faiths of the world are there. People differ in religion, language, dress, custom, tradition, habit and so on. And, it is nothing, but the rich and deep-rooted culture of the country that binds the people of this land together. There is a strong feeling of love for the country in the hearts of the people. This noble feeling is the main cause of oneness of our people despite many differences.

भारत एक अद्भुत देश है । उसका क्षेत्रफल व्यापक है । इसकी विशाल जनसंख्या तथा भौगोलिक स्थितियाँ विस्मयकारी हैं । संसार के सभी प्रचलित धर्म यहाँ विद्यमान हैं । लोग धर्म, भाषा, पोशाक, रीति-रिवाज, परम्परा, आदत तथा इसी तरह की अन्य बातों में भिन्नता रखते हैं । और, यह अन्य कोई बात नहीं, केवल देश की समृद्धि और गहराई तक जड़ जमाए हुए संस्कृति है जो इस देश के लोगों को एकता में बाँधे हुए है । देश के लिए लोगों के मन में प्रबल प्यार की भावना है । यही उत्कृष्ट भावना अनेक विषमताओं के बावजूद हमारे लोगों की एकता का प्रमुख कारण है।



Terrorism is a cowardly act of the terrorist groups, who wish to disturb the peace of the country. They want to keep the people in a constant panic and fear and to prevent the country from becoming prosperous. Terrorism impacts the country gravely and has dangerous repercussions. In 2009 on 26/11, the terror attacks in Mumbai which claimed the life of 170 people, the parliament attack, and the attack on Pathankot air base are some examples of their cruelty.

Attacks on our forces in J & K by the terrorists has become a common phenomena. Terrorism is a threat to humanity. It should be curbed and crushed with a heavy hand. Terrorism should be globally condemned and the world should stand united against it and make all efforts to eradicate it.

आतंकी समूहों द्वारा देश की शांति में खलल डालने वाली कायराना हरकते आतंकवाद है। वे लोगों को आंतक व दहशत में रखना चाहते है और देश को समृद्ध बनाने से रोकना चाहते हैं। आतंकवाद देश को बुरी तरह प्रभावित करता है और इसके दूरगामी परिणाम खतरनाक होते हैं। सन् 2009 में 26/11 को मुम्बई में हुए आतंकी हमलों ने 170 लोगों की जान ले ली।

संसद पर आक्रमण, पठान कोट हवाई अड्डे पर हमला उनकी क्रूरता के कुछ उदाहरण हैं। जम्मू एवं कश्मीर में हमारे सशस्त्र बलों पर आतंकवादियों द्वारा हमले उनकी आदत बन गये हैं। आतंकवाद मानवता के लिये खतरा है। इसे कठोरतापूर्वक कुचल देना चाहिये। इसकी विश्वस्तर पर निन्दा की जानी चाहिये और विश्व को संगठित होकर इसके विरुद्ध खड़ा होना चाहिये। इसे जड़ से समाप्त करने की पूरी कोशिश करनी चाहिये।





The word 'discipline' means the training of the mind to produce self-control and habits of obedience. A disciplinarian trains himself in accordance with rules. He subjects himself to a certain mode of life. Discipline is needed in all walks of life but it is urgently needed in family. If a family is disciplined, it will lead to its progress and prosperity.

Discipline is a very important factor in the educational institutions. It is needed in schools, colleges and universities. As students come from different families, cultures and religions, they are required to be more disciplined. Order and safety which are the first and foremost factors for the growth and development of civilization are not possible without discipline.

अनुशासन शब्द का अर्थ है - आत्म-नियन्त्रण और आज्ञापालन की आदत डालने के लिए मस्तिष्क का प्रशिक्षण। एक अनुशासनप्रिय व्यक्ति स्वयं को नियमों के अनुरूप प्रशिक्षित करता है । वह एक खास तरह का जीवन जीने लगता जीवन के हर क्षेत्र में अनुशासन की आवश्यकता है परन्तु परिवार में इसकी आवश्यकता बहुत ज्यादा है । यदि परिवार अनुशासित है तो वह विकसित एवं समृद्ध होगा ।

अनुशासन वर्तमान शिक्षा संस्थाओं में एक महत्त्वपूर्ण घटक है । इसकी विद्यालयों, महाविद्यालयों और विश्वविद्यालयों में आवश्यकता है। क्योंकि विद्यार्थी विभिन्न परिवारों, संस्कृतियों और धर्मों से आते हैं, तो उनसे अधिक अनुशासित होने की अपेक्षा की जाती है । व्यवस्था और सुरक्षा जो कि सभ्यता की वृद्धि एवं विकास में प्रमुख घटक हैं, अनुशासन के बिना सम्भव नहीं




Role of newspapers has always been of great importance, not only in India but also in other countries. Every newspaper tries to establish its identity and wins the loyalty of its readers. It is done through the presentation of its material or news coverage. Newspapers contain public grievances and reflect public opinion.

It is through newspapers that the policies and actions of the government are conveyed to the people. In return people give their opinion, they praise or criticise them. Newspapers are the watch dog of human rights. They keep the public aware of what right or wrong goes on in the society. They can make or break the governments.

समाचार-पत्रों की भूमिका न सिर्फ भारत में बल्कि दूसरे देशों में भी हमेशा बहुत महत्त्वपूर्ण रही है। प्रत्येक समाचार-पत्र अपनी पहचान बनाने की कोशिश करता है और अपने पाठकों का विश्वास जीतता है । यह कार्य समाचार पत्र अपने प्रस्तुतिकरण व अपने समाचार पत्र में समाचारों के माध्यम से करते हैं ।

समाचार पत्र में लोगों की शिकायतें और उनके विचार शामिल होते हैं सरकार की नीतियाँ और उसके कार्य समाचार पत्रों के माध्यम से ही लोगों तक (जनता) पहुँचते हैं । बदले में लोग अपने विचार, राय, प्रशंसा व आलोचना व्यक्त करते हैं । समाचार पत्र मानवाधिकारों के संरक्षक हैं । समाज में क्या गलत या सही हो रहा है उस सबके प्रति जनता को समाचार पत्र ही जागरूक करते हैं । वे सरकार को उखाड़ और बना सकते हैं।





Rajasthan has a vast stretch of desert. Most of the land being devoid of plantation, soil erosion is a very common phenomenon. The soil being bare, the wind picks up speed due to the flat land and blows away the unprotected soil.

Even though rain falls infrequently in Rajasthan; when it does rain, it causes a large run of surplus water that washes away the top layer of the soil as we saw during the rainy season of 2017 in some parts of Rajasthan. The flood in Pali, Jalore and Rajsamand etc. caused a lot of soil erosion. The best step in the direction of soil conservation is planting appropriate trees. The construction of bunds to check the flow of water will also prove helpful.

राजस्थान में रेगिस्तान का बहुत बड़ा क्षेत्र है । अधिकांश भूमि वृक्षों से रहित होने के कारण मृदा अपरदन एक सामान्य परिदृश्य है । मिट्टी के खुले होने के कारण और भूमि समतल होने के कारण हवा तेजी से बहती है और असुरक्षित मिट्टी को उड़ा ले जाती है। यद्यपि राजस्थान में वर्षा रुक-रुककर होती है परन्तु जब होती है तो बड़ी मात्रा में फालतू पानी बह जाता है जिससे मिट्टी की ऊपरी सतह बह जाती है। जैसा कि हमने वर्ष 2017 की वर्षा ऋतु में राजस्थान के कुछ भागों में देखा था। पाली, जालौर, राजसमन्द आदि जिलों में बाढ़ ने काफी मात्रा में मृदा अपरदन किया। मृदा-संरक्षण की दिशा में सर्वोत्तम कम है- समुचित वृक्षारोपण । जल के बहाव को रोकने के लिए बन्धों का निर्माण भी इस कार्य में सहायक होगा ।





India is known for its spiritual and ethical values from the time immemorial. Spiritualism is the life line of Indian culture. The most ancient book on religion 'The Rigveda' belongs to India. The most perfect science of physical, mental and spiritual health "The Yoga' belongs to India.

Indian history is full of such episodes when people not only renounced their property and family but also their lives to keep their words and ideals. Universal brotherhood, motherhood in earth; work is worship are a few of those innumerable principles that signify the spiritual and ethical values in the society of ancient India.


भारत शाश्वत काल से अपने आध्यात्मिक व नैतिक मूल्यों के लिए जाना जाता है। अध्यात्मवाद भारतीय संस्कृति की जीवन रेखा है। धर्म पर सर्वाधिक प्राचीन ग्रन्थ 'ऋग्वेद' भारत में ही रचा गया। शारीरिक, मानसिक व आध यात्मिक स्वास्थ्य का सम्पूर्ण विज्ञान 'योग' भी भारत की ही सम्पत्ति है।

भारतीय इतिहास ऐसी घटनाओं से परिपूर्ण है जब लोगों ने अपने वचन व आदर्शों के लिए न केवल सम्पत्ति व परिवार का बल्कि अपने जीवन का भी परित्याग कर दिया। विश्व बन्धुत्व, पृथ्वी में मातृत्व भाव, कर्म में पूजा का भाव उन असंख्य सिद्धान्तों में से कुछ हैं जो प्राचीन भारतीय समाज में प्रचलित आध्यात्मिक व नैतिक मूल्यों का महत्व प्रदर्शित करते हैं।





Francis Bacon had said, "Reading makes a complete man". A complete man means a perfect man who is knowledgeable, morally good and mentally and spiritually enlightened. By reading good books, a man can overcome his shortcomings and achieve perfection of mind, body and heart.

Reading books on different branches of knowledge sharpens mental faculties of a man and enables him to formulate his thinking and character. Moreover, books contain thoughts, experience and knowledge of the great minds. They enable a man to think deeply for his own good. Thus, reading makes a man perfect.


फ्रान्सिस बेकन ने कहा था, "पठन-पाठन मनुष्य को निपुण बनाता है।'' निपुण मनुष्य का अर्थ है दोषरहित मनुष्य जो ज्ञानवान, नैतिक रूप से अच्छा और मानसिक और आध्यात्मिक रूप से निपुण हो। अच्छी पुस्तकें पढ़कर व्यक्ति अपनी कमियाँ दूर कर सकता है और मस्तिष्क, शरीर और आत्मा की पूर्णता प्राप्त कर सकता है।

अलग-अलग विषयों की पुस्तकों को पढ़ने से व्यक्ति की मानसिक क्षमता तेज होती है और उसको अपनी सोच और चरित्र बनाने में सक्षम बनाती है। इसके अतिरिक्त पुस्तकों में महान लोगों के विचार, अनुभव और ज्ञान होते हैं । वे व्यक्ति को अपनी भलाई के लिए गहन विचार करने में सक्षम बनाते हैं । इस प्रकार पठन-पाठन व्यक्ति को निपुण बनाता है ।





'A man is known by the company he keeps'. The saying implies that company influences one's character and personality. Usually this company comprises friends and books. If friends are good, the influence will also be good. The same is true of books. Good books help a man become good while bad books spoil him. Therefore it is always wise to associate with good friends and read good books. Their number doesn't matter. Just as few good friends are enough to enjoy the fruit of friendship, similarly, few good books are enough to inculcate in oneself the noble qualities of a good life.

'व्यक्ति को उसकी संगत से जाना जाता है ।' इस कथन का अभिप्राय है कि संगत ही किसी व्यक्ति के चरित्र और व्यक्तित्व को प्रभावित करती है। आमतौर पर यह संगत मित्रों और पुस्तकों की होती है । यदि मित्र अच्छे हैं तो उनका प्रभाव भी अच्छा होता है। पुस्तकों के बारे में भी यही सत्य है ।

अच्छी पुस्तकें मनुष्य को अच्छा बनने में सहायक होती है जबकि बुरी पुस्तकें उसको बिगाड़ देती है। इसलिये हमेशा अच्छे मित्रों के साथ रहमा और अच्छी पुस्तकें पढ़ना ही बुद्धिमत्तापूर्ण होता है । उनकी संख्या महत्त्वपूर्ण नहीं होती। जैसे थोड़े से अच्छे मित्र मित्रता का सुख भोगने के लिये पर्याप्त होते हैं वैसे ही थोड़ी सी अच्छी पुस्तकें व्यक्ति में अच्छे जीवन के अच्छे गुणों की सिखाने के लिये पर्याप्त होती है ।

 
 
 
 
Shakespeare's famous quotē 'Sweet are the uses of Adversity' is a whole measure of truth packed into a few words. At some point of life, almost all of us have to go through bad times. Challenges come to us in many forms. But these challenges make us only wiser and more courageous. The best way to deal with hard times is to hold onto one's patience and good sense.

When one goes through difficulty with this attitude, one comes out as a polished individual. Problems leave us with better understanding of life. Thus adversity brings the best form of us. We must not lose courage and patience in life.

शेक्सपीयर का प्रसिद्ध उद्धरण 'Sweet are the uses of Adversity' थोड़े से शब्दों में कहा गया बहुत बड़ा सत्य है । लगभग हम सभी को जीवन में कभी न कभी बुरे समय से गुजरना पड़ता है । हमारे सामने अनेक रूपों में चुनौतियाँ आती हैं । लेकिन ये चुनौतियाँ हमें अधिक बुद्धिमान व अधिक साहसी ही बनाती हैं ।

कठिन समय से निबटने का सबसे अच्छा तरीका है- धैर्य व समझदारी बनाये रखना । जब व्यक्ति इस दृष्टिकोण के साथ कठिनाइयों का सामना करता है तो वह एक परिष्कृत व्यक्ति के रूप में सामने आता है । समस्याओं से हमें जीवन की अधिक अच्छी समझ प्राप्त होती है । इस प्रकार बुरे दिन हमारा सबसे श्रेष्ठ रूप सामने लाते हैं । हमें जीवन में उत्साह और धैर्य का त्याग कभी नहीं करना चाहिए।




The person who impressed me most was Dr A.P.J. Abul Kalam. He was a renowned scientist. He came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He became the 11th President of India in the year 2002 and continued till 2007. He was the recipient of many Prestigious awards including, Bharat Ratna in 1997. He lived his life with great simplicity. He wrote many books. He was a man of strong will power. He died on July 27, 2015.


डॉ. ए. पी. जे. अब्दुल कलाम वह व्यक्ति थे, जिन्होंने मुझे सर्वाधिक प्रभावित किया। वह एक सुप्रसिद्ध वैज्ञानिक थे। प्रक्षेपास्त्रों के विकास एवं अंतरिक्ष में इन्हें भेजने की तकनीक के बूते पर वे भारत के मिसाईल पुरुष के रूप में जाने जाते हैं। वे सन् 2002 में भारत के 11वें राष्ट्रपति बने और सन् 2007 तक रहे। वे भारत रत्न (1997) सहित कई प्रतिष्ठित पुरुस्कारों को पाने वाले व्यक्ति थे। उन्होंने बहुत ही सादगी से अपना जीवन जिया। उन्होंने कई पुस्तकें लिखी। वे मजबूत इच्छा शक्ति वाले व्यक्ति थे। दिनांक 27 जुलाई 2015 को इनका निधन हो गया।




Patriotism is a sacred feeling. It inspires us to do everything for the good of our country. We remember many patriots like Mahatma Gandhi, Subhash Chandra Bose, Chandra Shekhar Azad, Bhagat Singh and many more. They sacrificed their lives for their motherland.

We are proud of all our patriots. They are our role models. Their love and dedication for the country inspire us. We should make our best efforts for the upliftment of our motherland. We must be very sincere in performing our duties for the nation. We must learn the dedication from the deeds of our patriots. We must remember that our personal gains must not be above the nation. 


देश भक्ति एक पवित्र अनुभूति है। यह हमारे देश के भले के लिये हमें बहुत कुछ करने हेतु प्रेरित करती है। महात्मा गाँधी, सुभाषचन्द्र बोस, चन्द्रशेखर आजाद, भगतसिंह जैसे कई देश भक्तों को हम याद करते हैं। उन्होंने अपना जीवन मातृभूमि के लिये समर्पित कर दिया। हमारे सभी देशभक्तों पर हमें गर्व है। वे हमारे आदर्श हैं।

उनका देश के प्रति प्यार और समर्पण हमें प्रेरित करता है। हमारी मातृभूमि के उत्थान के लिये हमें सर्वश्रेष्ठ प्रयास करने चाहिये। राष्ट्र के प्रति कर्तव्य निर्वाह में हमें निष्कपट रहना चाहिये। हमारे देश भक्तों के बलिदानों से हमें सीखना चाहिये। हमें याद रखना चाहिये कि हमारे निजी स्वार्थ देश से बढ़कर नहीं है।

The situation is that the attraction of money has thrown the government officials even on the highest ranks into deep trench of fall where there is no hope of coming out.

But if we pay little attention towards the importance our moral, cultural and spiritual heritage and take an oath to mould our life according to those values, we can still achieve ancient glory.

Exercise 13

By waking up early in the morning one gets good health and happiness. The morning air is clean and fresh. Therefore a man feels fresh the whole day by walking in the open and fresh air. Besides this in the peaceful atmoshpere of morning, the mind works better. It is natural that the study done in such a period is more effective. Contrary to it the people who wake up late have to work late in the night. But keeping awake till late in the night is not good for health. Side by side the capacity of mind becomes less in the late hours of the night. There are very few people whose mind can work in the night without difficulty. Therefore from ancient time the great men of the world have been laying stress on waking up early in the morning.

Exercise 14

There is snow crown on the head of our Motherland, green clothes of dense forests on her organs; innumerable rivers like the Indus, the Ganga, the Yamuna, the Narmada, the Kaveri, the Godavari etc., are playing in her lap. The Golden Lanka is ever blossoming like a lotus under her feet. In the North great mountain the Himalayas, spreading both arms towards East and West, is giving us the gift of fearlessness. The snow clad mountain ranges, vast rivers, green meadows, the deserts clad in sheets of sand, dense forests, blazing sunlight during the day, but cool light of the moon in the night, all these things have made India the best playground of nature.

Your load is not lighter than mine and you are not more powerful than I.” The latter answered, “I have a thing which makes my load lighter.” The former said, “If possible, please let me also have that thing.” The latter answered, “You already possess this thing.” The former said, “What is that and by what name do you call that?” The latter answered, “That is called contentment.” It’s true, contentment makes the load lighter.

Exercise 16

Our country is a great one. For centuries our history has been grand. Not only the Eastern countries but also all the Western countries bear the stamp of our ancient culture. Our philosophy and arts have influenced the Western thoughts and life too much. Today we are trying to lead in the race of progress.

We should keep it in our mind if our country makes progress, our future will be grand.

Having renounced the feeling of selfishness altogether, they adopted the great principle of the whole Earth is family’, the symbol of real civilization, it was the time when India used to oblige the whole world by not only its religious and spiritual teachings but also by science, art-skills and by business ventures. The plant of Indian erudition, which was nurtured by the ancient scholars through their diligence is getting sapped day-by-day.

Often I knew that my opponents have made their witneses ready knavishly and if I had encouraged my party or his witneses to tell lies, we could have won the case. But I had always been putting restriction on this lure. I remember only one incidence when I respected after winning the case that my party has cheated me. From my inner soul I always wished that I should win the case only when my party’s case is just. I don’t remember if I ever while setting my fees, linked this with winning bet. I never desired for more or less than my fees irrespective of the fact whether my party won or lost.

Exercise 21

Walking in the morning is very useful for health. The fresh air of morning not only purifies lungs but also provides us with regeneration. Our heart also becomes jubilant. This is the reason why I regularly go for a walk everyday. Some people remain lying in bed for long. This is a bad habit. We all should avoid this. Due to sleeping for long time our body becomes tardy and laziness surrounds us for day long. Our mind does not take interest in any work. Our elders often say that “Who. goes to bed early, and rises early never falls ill.” The person who does not rise early from the sleep does not get real enjoyment of life.

Exercise 22

The children are often heard saying that they wish they had grown earlier likewise the elders wishing they had become young again. Every age has its own joys and sorrows and the person who instead of wasting time in useless repentance, enjoys the givings of every age is the most contented one. Childhood is such a stage when the responsibilities are less, when the things in our life always use to come before us in new form and when one gets joy in ordinary works like playing in rain or snow. But the child is not free to do anything according to its wish and always finds itself listening “Don’t do this, don’t do that.”

Exercise 23

The trees were loaded with fruits and flowers and rivers were full of clean water. The people had love and sympathy. All shared the joys and sorrows of one another. Even after 68 years of independence we are not completely happy today. Our growing population and communal riots are the main problems. Only we are to solve them.

When you have to try, why then to pray? I have to try, therefore I need prayer, I am the doer of trying. But the result is not in may hand. Result depends on the will of God. How much I will do by trying? How low is my power? What can I do alone with out the help of God? I go on proceeding towards the truth even them I can’t reach my goal without the grace of God. I do try to cut the path, but in the end I will cut the path that in the middle my feet are about to be cut, who can say this. So on my own accord I will reach the goal, this type of ego is useless.

Exercise 29

Man has got power in the form of time from God. The man who uses this power properly, gets physical and spiritual pleasures. By the proper use of time an ignorant man gets knowledge, foolish man gets wisdom and weak man gets power. Proper use of time makes the man god. Time should be used like precious objects. The man who not doing so, wastes the wealth of time uselessly, remains idle and inactive, he suicides. Due to sitting idle, not only the time is wasted but also the thoughts of mind become polluted, soul becomes sinful, age falls down, and bliss of soul, peace and conteniment are not achieved.

We have to prove the superiority of Indian knowledge in the world again, and this is possible only when we can revert past the golden papers of the past and join them in the current context.

Exercise 34
