# Causative Verbs in English: Let, Make, Have, Get, Help

 

The English verbs let, make, have, get, and help are called causative verbs because they cause something else to happen.

Here are some specific examples of how causative verbs work in English sentences.

How to use causative verbs in English



##### LET = permit something to happen

Grammatical structure:

    LET + PERSON/THING + VERB (base form)

Examples:

    I don’t let my kids watch violent movies.
    Mary’s father won’t let her adopt a puppy because he’s allergic to dogs.
    Our boss doesn’t let us eat lunch at our desks; we have to eat in the cafeteria.
    Oops! I wasn’t paying attention while cooking, and I let the food burn.
    Don’t let the advertising expenses surpass $1000.

Remember: The past tense of let is also let; there is no change!

Note: The verbs allow and permit are more formal ways to say “let.” However, with allow and permit, we use to + verb:

    I don’t allow my kids to watch violent movies.
    Our boss doesn’t permit us to eat lunch at our desks.


##### MAKE = force or require someone to take an action

Grammatical structure:

    MAKE + PERSON + VERB (base form)

Examples:

    After Billy broke the neighbor’s window, his parents made him pay for it.
    My ex-boyfriend loved sci-fi and made me watch every episode of his favorite show.
    The teacher made all the students rewrite their papers, because the first drafts were not acceptable.

Note: When using the verbs force and require, we must use to + verb.

    The school requires the students to wear uniforms.
    “Require” often implies that there is a rule.
    The hijacker forced the pilots to take the plane in a different direction.
    “Force” often implies violence, threats, or extremely strong pressure




##### HAVE = give someone else the responsibility to do something

Grammatical structure:

    HAVE + PERSON + VERB (base form)
    HAVE + THING + PAST PARTICIPLE OF VERB

Examples of grammatical structure #1:

    I’ll have my assistant call you to reschedule the appointment.
    The businessman had his secretary make copies of the report.

Examples of grammatical structure #2:

    I’m going to have my hair cut tomorrow.
    We’re having our house painted this weekend.
    Bob had his teeth whitened; his smile looks great!
    My washing machine is broken; I need to have it repaired.

Note: In informal speech, we often use get in these cases:

    I’m going to get my hair cut tomorrow.
    We’re getting our house painted this weekend.
    Bob got his teeth whitened; his smile looks great!
    My washing machine is broken; I need to get it repaired.


#### GET = convince/encourage someone to do something

Grammatical structure:

    GET + PERSON + TO + VERB

Examples:

    How can we get all the employees to arrive on time?
    My husband hates housework; I can never get him to wash the dishes!
    I was nervous about eating sushi, but my brother got me to try it at a Japanese restaurant.
    The non-profit got a professional photographer to take photos at the event for free.




##### HELP = assist someone in doing something

Grammatical structure:

    HELP + PERSON + VERB (base form)
    HELP + PERSON + TO + VERB

After “help,” you can use “to” or not – both ways are correct. In general, the form without “to” is more common:

    He helped me carry the boxes.
    He helped me to carry the boxes.
    Reading before bed helps me relax.
    Reading before bed helps me to relax.

 
 
 
 
 
 
# Causative Verbs : Structures & Examples

The causatives are the verbs that are used to indicate that one person causes another person to do something for the first person. One can cause somebody to do something for him/her by asking, paying, requesting, or forcing the person.
Causative Verbs:

    Have
    Get
    Make

This kind of verbs constitutes different structures for their sentences.


### Have

Structure 1: 

Subject + have (any tense) + object (usually person) + base form of verb + . . . .

Example:

John had Alex clean the bedroom.
He always has me do his work.
Mary will have Alex prepare her homework.

Structure 2:

Subject + have (any tense) + object (usually thing) + past participle form of verb + . . . .

Example:

John had his car washed.
He always has his work done.
Mary will have her homework prepared.



### Get

Structure 1:

Subject + get (any tense) + object (usually person) + infinitive + . . . .

Example:

John got Alex to clean the bedroom.
He always gets me to do his work.
Mary will get Alex to prepare her homework.

Structure 2:

Subject + have (any tense) + object (usually thing) + past participle form of verb + . . . .

Example:

John got his car washed.
He always gets his work done.
Mary will get her homework prepared.



### Make

‘Make’ is stronger than ‘have/get’. It constitutes only one structure as it does not take anything ‘passive’ as its object.    

Subject + make (any tense) + object (always person) + base form of verb + . . .

Example:

Robert made me beat that little child.  
He always makes me do his work.
Mary will make me prepare her homework.  
I made him wash my car.
He makes me laugh whenever I am down.

Note: According to the grammar rules and structures, there are two more similar verbs that are not causative verbs by definition but they constitute similar sentence structures.

Those two verbs are:

    Let
    Help
    

### Let

‘Let’ means ‘allow/permit’ but the use of ‘let’ in the sentence is different from these words.

Structure:

Subject + let (any tense) + object (always person) + base form of verb +. . .

Example:

Robert let me escape the prison. 
Let me go. (Subject ‘you’ is hidden)
The teacher let the students discuss among themselves.   
I let him drive my car.
Let’s (let us) laugh and live a happy life.   

The verb ‘permit’/’allow’ does not follow this structure. It follows the regular sentence pattern of English language.

Subject + permit/allow + object + infinitive + . . . .

Example:

John allowed him to drive his car.
He always allows him to do that.
The teacher allowed me to sit for the exams. 


### Help

Help is not actually a causative verb either but is generally regarded as a causative verb because of its grammatical use in a sentence. It has two structures.

Structure 1:

Subject + help (any tense) + object (usually person) + base form of verb +. . .

Example:

Robert helped me escape the prison. 
He helps me prepare my presentations. 
The teacher had helped the students understand a complex theory.  
I helped him learn driving.
It will help you move on.    

Structure 2:

Subject + help + object + infinitive + . . . .

Example:

John helped him to lift his car.
He always helps me to find my stuff.
The teacher helped me to understand the topic.
